      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi there! I’m <strong>Adari Samuel Prasad</strong>, currently in my 2nd year of B.Tech specializing in <strong>AI & Machine Learning</strong> at Malla Reddy College of Engineering and Technology. Based in Hyderabad, I've always been driven by technology and a passion for solving complex problems using intelligent systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the last year, I’ve sharpened my skills in Python and Java, explored deep learning techniques, and completed real-world projects such as a <em>Smart Traffic Control System</em> with YOLO and a <em>Sign Language Translator</em> using computer vision. I thrive on experimenting with new technologies, contributing to hackathons, and collaborating in teams to transform ideas into practical solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of academics, I enjoy participating in tech communities, attending workshops, and expanding my knowledge in data science, web development, and AI-driven systems. My goal is to create impactful solutions that bridge technology and real-world needs.
      </p>
